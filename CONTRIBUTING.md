# Contributing to the Splice repository

In order to setup your development environment, please see the [Development README](DEVELOPMENT.md).

TBD: futher contribution guidelines, s.a. [Canton's Contributing Guide](https://github.com/DACH-NY/canton/blob/main/contributing/README.md)

## Picking up issues

Splice maintainers may use the following GitHub issue labels to highlight issues suitable for newer contributors:

- [`help wanted`](https://github.com/canton-network/splice/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22):
  tasks of various sizes and difficulty levels suitable for contributors outside of the maintainers team
- [`good first issue`](https://github.com/canton-network/splice/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22):
  easier tasks that are well-suited for onboarding to the code base

Note that not all `good first issue`s are also `help wanted`; some may require access to infrastructure (CI, test deployments) that is not openly available.

If you are planning to work on an issue please assign yourself to it (if you are able to) or leave a comment, to avoid duplicate work across contributors.

## Testing

Every contribution must be tested in an automated test! For further details see the [Testing README](TESTING.md).

Also note that the splice CI [enforces](https://github.com/cncf/dco2) that all commits on a pull request contain a valid `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>` line,
to confirm adherence to the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) requirements.

## Git Hygiene

### Branch Naming

If you are a Splice Contributor and therefore have write permissions to the Splice repo directly,
please prefix branch names by your name, followed by a slash and a descriptive name:

`<yourname>/<descriptivename>`

For example, if Bob is working on issue 4242 to "fix FooTest", he could name his branch:

`bob/fix-footest/4242`.

### Merge Strategy

PRs are merged into `main` using **squash and merge**. This collapses all commits in the PR into a single commit on `main`, keeping the history clean and linear.

### Squash-and-Merge Commit Messages

Because the squash commit is the only record of the change on `main`, its message matters.
Follow these conventions:

* **Title (first line):** A concise summary of the change, written in imperative mood (e.g., "Add external transaction hash to Scan API", not "Added …" or "Adds …"). GitHub defaults the title to the PR title, so make sure the PR title is descriptive.
* **Body:** GitHub auto-populates the body with the list of individual commit messages. Clean this up before merging:
  - Remove noise such as "address review comments", "fixes", "format", "refactor", etc.
  - Keep a brief summary of *what* the change does and *why*. A few bullet points are fine.
  - Reference the related GitHub issue, e.g., `Fixes #1234` or `Part of #1234`.
  - Example of a good squash commit message:
    ```
    Add external transaction hash to Scan API (#1234)

    - Store the external transaction hash from the ledger API in the
      update_history_transactions table.
    - Expose the hash through the v2/updates and v2/updates/{update_id}
      Scan endpoints.
    - Gate hash inclusion behind a configurable threshold record time for BFT-safety.

    Signed-off-by: Git-Hygienic-Dev <ghd@example.com>
    ```
* **CI tags:** Post-merge process ignores CI tags (e.g., `[ci]`, `[static]`), so always remove them.
* **Sign-off:** The squash commit must include a valid `Signed-off-by` line. Ensure it is present in the commit message body.

## TODO Comments

TBD

## DB Migrations

Refer to [the main README on migrations](apps/common/src/main/resources/db/migration/README.md).

## Daml Changes

### Approval for Daml Changes

Adopting Daml changes on a prod system requires a vote from a majority of SVs. Therefore, before
proposing any Daml changes, please reach out to the [Splice Maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) to discuss
your proposal and the best way to secure support for your changes first.

### Daml Lock Files

To prevent accidental changes to dar files, we commit their current package IDs with the repo,
in daml/dars.lock. CI verifies that those package IDs are correct. If you intentionally make
changes in daml code, please run `sbt damlDarsLockFileUpdate` and commit the updated `dars.lock`
file along with your dar changes.

### Backwards-compatible Daml changes

We require all Daml changes to be backwards-compatible. See the [Upgrading and Extending Daml Applications
section of the Canton docs](https://docs.digitalasset.com/build/3.4/sdlc-howtos/smart-contracts/upgrade/).

In the early days of Daml 3.0 upgrading of variants and enums was not supported, which is why there
are variant constructors with names like `ExtFoo` in our codebase. They used to be a workaround for
this lack of upgradeability. You can ignore them, and just add new enum and variant constructors directly.

Care still must be taken to not accidentally change an enum into a variant: enums are `data` type declarations
that only consist of nullary constructors. They are compiled to Daml-LF enums, which is nice as that
ensures that the codegens like the Java codegen define these as Jave enums as well. **Make sure to only add
further nullary constructors to types that only have nullary constructors.**


### Daml Numerics

To represent Daml `Numeric`s for any user facing APIs (console commands), we use `scala.math.BigDecimal`s.
We use Scala BigDecimals instead of Java BigDecimals (that are used in the Daml repo) because
integers, floats etc. are automatically converted
to Scala BigDecimals by the Scala compiler unlike Java BigDecimals
(`wallet.tap(10)` vs `wallet.tap(new java.math.BigDecimal(10))`).

To represent Daml Numerics in Protobuf we use `string`s (there is no Protobuf BigDecimal type). Conversions to
and from `string`s should occur via `org.lfdecentralizedtrust.splice.util.Proto.encode/tryDecode`.

When interacting with the Ledger API, we convert the Scala BigDecimals to Java BigDecimals.

Overall, please refer to the `wallet.tap` command implementation for the canonical handling of Daml Numerics.

## Message Definitions

* All Protobuf definitions should be using [`proto3`](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)
* Avoid wrapping primitive types in a message structure unless future extensibility will likely be required
* Use a plural name for `repeated` fields
* Use `string` fields with a suffix `contract_id` to store contract ids
* Use `string` fields with a suffix `party_id` to store party ids

## OpenAPI / Scan API Changes

### Modifying BFT-consensus types

Update history types served by the Scan API are serialized to JSON and compared across SVs for BFT
consensus.  **Any** schema change — adding, removing, or renaming a field — will cause JSON
divergence between SVs running different code versions, breaking consensus.

For any such change you must ensure a coordination mechanism is in place (e.g., a threshold record time
gate) so that the new schema is not emitted before all SVs have deployed the updated code.

#### Adding or removing required fields

Adding a new required field means new-code SVs emit a key that old-code SVs do not; removing one
has the opposite effect.  Both break JSON equality.  Gate the change behind a threshold record time or
equivalent mechanism so that all SVs switch over simultaneously.

#### Adding optional fields

Optional fields are especially easy to add without realizing the consequences: circe emits `null`
for `Option[_]` fields by default instead of omitting them, so new-code SVs emit `"field": null`
while old-code SVs omit the key entirely.

If you need to add an optional field to any type in the update history schema:

1. **Prefer making the field required** with a sensible default — this avoids the problem entirely
   (though you still need a gate for the new key itself).
2. If the field must be optional, use `Option[OmitNullString]` (via `x-scala-type` in the OpenAPI
   spec) and wire it into `ScanJsonSupport` using the `omitWhenNone` helper so the key is omitted
   from JSON when `None`.
3. Add the new type (if it is a new leaf type) to the compliance check in
   `UpdateHistoryOmitNullStringComplianceTest` — this test verifies that no `Option[_]` fields
   exist on BFT-consensus types unless they are `Option[OmitNullString]`.

See `ScanJsonSupport.scala` for the full set of custom encoders and their documentation.

## Config Parameters

* name flags as `enableXXX` instead of `disableXXX` to avoid a double negation

## Code Layout

* Place `.proto` files in `src/main/protobuf`
* Prefer having a single `.proto` definition per service.
* Refer to generated Protobuf classes with a package prefix, e.g., `v0.MyMessage` instead of `MyMessage`.
  This avoids name conflicts with our hand-written classes.

## Domain Specific Naming

* Use `listXXX`, `acceptXXX`, `rejectXXX`, `withdrawXXX` for managing proposals, requests etc.
* [Beware of the differences](https://www.bkacontent.com/gs-commonly-confused-words-amount-number-and-quantity)
  between `amount`, `quantity` and `number`: To keep things simple across the repository,
  we consistently use only the term **`amount`**
* Between `sender`/`receiver` and `payer`/`payee`: please use **`sender`/`receiver`**

## Frontend Code

### Background

This section discusses how to contribute, or add new frontend code for an app. To understand how to run frontends locally, see [Building and Running the Wallet and Splitwell Apps](#building-and-running-the-wallet-and-splitwell-apps).

Frontend code projects are managed via [`npm workspaces`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces). This gives us a way to manage multiple distinct NPM packages all co-located in the same monorepo, and confers several benefits:

- One local monorepo package can be installed as a dependency of another, enabling "easy" code-sharing.
- With `npm install`, all dependencies of all workspace projects are installed in the root `node_modules` folders, giving us de-deduplication.
- If all workspace projects share common scripts, you can easily run that script across all workspaces in one command.
- All required `npm` commands are issued from `sbt compile`, so there should not be a need to run e.g. `npm install` directly.

### New Packages

In this section only, the term "root-level directory" will describe the workspace root, which is inside `apps/` (**not** the _repo_ root directory).

If you want to add a new package to the workspace, first register its directory in the root-level `apps/package.json` workspaces key. The directory referenced here must contain a `package.json` of its own defining the workspace package itself -- name, dependencies, etc.

Then add the new package to `build.sbt` following the examples from the existing frontend packages.

Running `sbt compile` (or manually `npm install` from the root) installs the dependencies of all registered workspace packages.

Make sure your package contains at least the scripts `build`, `fix`, `check`, and `start`. This enables the use of (e.g.) `npm run build --workspaces` to run the build script for all packages in the workspace at once, as well as proper integration with `sbt`.

Your new package will need its own `tsconfig.json` file that inherits from the root tsconfig. See any existing workspace package for an example.

### Common libs

In `apps/common/frontend` we have an NPM package containing common code. This package (named `common-frontend`) can be installed with `npm install @lfdecentralizedtrust/splice-common-frontend -w my-workspace-pkg`. You can import anything from it with `import { ... } from '@lfdecentralizedtrust/splice-common-frontend'` in your package's source code.

You're also free to add more things in `common-frontend` to use across multiple frontend apps. This can really include anything: utility functions, reusable React components, shared config, etc. Just ensure whatever you add is exposed via the lib's entrypoint, `index.ts` (we use the [barreling](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/barrel) technique to expose all modules from the root of the library).

## Conversions between Java & Scala types

Because we use the Java bindings and codegen, we need to convert
between Java and Scala types, e.g., `Seq` and `java.util.List`.  We
try to use Scala types whereever possible so we delay the conversion
to Java types until the last possible point and convert from Scala to
Java as early as possible.

To convert, import `scala.jdk.CollectionConverters.*`. You can then use `asScala` and `asJava` methods.

## Dev Docs

We publish docs from each commit from `main` to
https://canton-network.github.io/splice/. This can
often be useful to answer support requests with a docs link even if
those docs are still very recent.
