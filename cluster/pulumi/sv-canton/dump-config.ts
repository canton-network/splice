   * Outputting to a different file is also a pain, as currently it's handled in the make files. We would either need to change the make logic to be aware of migrations so that it runs
   * the dump-config for each sv/migration (don't really see any sane way of doing this), or we would need to move the file writing directly in the typescript code
   * (this sounds like the sanest approach but it would require a lot more changes)
