Name Allocation
===============

Our deployment topologies require many servers representing nodes and apps to be deployed simultaneously.
We use the following prefixes for their names:
- dso: for the servers operated by the dso
- alice: for servers operated by alice acting as a self-hosted validator operator
- bob: for servers operated by bob acting as a self-hosted validator operator

Test Setup
==========

Most of our tests share the same long-running Canton instance,
see `./start-canton.sh` and `simple-topology-canton.conf`.
Test isolation is implemented by each test using unique Daml party names and leveraging Daml privacy features.

Most of our tests use the same definition of the Splice setup,
see `simple-topology.conf`.
To avoid port collisions, tests run sequentially, see `ConcurrentEnvironmentLimiter`.

Port Allocation
===============

Chosen ports should be between 4001 and 32767,
as the other ports tend to be either reserved or will be randomly chosen for client connections:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port

## Manually allocated ports

Consequently, we use the following port allocation scheme when manually allocating static ports:
A port number has five digits and is of the form `<Network Index><Node Index><API Index>`, where:

- `<Network Index>` is between 5 and 31 and uniquely identifies a splice instance.
- `<Node Index>` is between 0 and 9 and uniquely identifies the node within the network.
- `<API Index>` is between 0 and 99 and uniquely identifies an API exposed by the node.

**Exception:** Ports used by CometBFT instances are allocated using a dedicated scheme based on the CometBFT default ports.
All CometBFT ports we use (both locally and on clusters) are of the form `266<Node Index><API Index>`,
where `<Node Index>` defaults to 0 and `<API Index>` is one of `6` (P2P), `7` (RPC) and `0` (Prometheus metrics).

### Allocated Networks (Network Index)

To avoid collisions with our grpc-web proxy (which proxies ports `N` to `N+1000`, see below),
all network indices must be odd numbers.

- `5`: Default for integration tests
  - See `simple-topology.conf`, `simple-topology-canton.conf`.
- `9`: Local runbook integration test and participant identities dump test, `sv1Local`, `aliceValidatorLocal`
  - See `local-sv-node`, `local-validator-node`
- `11`: Ports forwarded from remote participant as part of `cncluster [participant|sequencer|mediator]_console`
- `15`: Simulated time
  - See `simple-topology.conf` with ports bumped by 10k, `simple-topology-canton-simtime.conf`
- `25`: Toxi-proxy ports
  - See `simple-topology.conf` with ports bumped by 20k (currently for the ledger API, but may be extended for other connections in the future)
- `26`: Reserved for CometBFT
- `27`: Standalone Canton instances launched in integration tests
- `28`: Canton instances used for soft domain migration tests

### Allocated Nodes (Node Index)

- `1`: SV1
- `2`: SV2
- `3`: SV3
- `4`: SV4
- `5`: Alice
- `6`: Bob
- `7`: Splitwell

### Allocated APIs (API Index)

- `00`: Canton, Prometheus metrics endpoint
- `01`: Participant, Ledger API
- `02`: Participant, Admin API
- `03`: Validator, Admin API
- `04`: Wallet, Admin API
- `05`: DSO, Admin API
- `07`: Mediator, Admin API
- `08`: Sequencer, Public API
- `09`: Sequencer, Admin API
- `10`: Sequencer, BFT P2P API
- `11`: ANS user, Admin API
- `12`: Scan, Admin API
- `13`: Splitwell, Admin API
- `14`: SV, Public API + Admin API
- `15`: SV, Admin API (reserved)
- `16`: Sync Operator, Admin API

### Examples

- `5301` is the Ledger API of Participant 3 in Splice network instance 5.
- `17309` is the Admin API of Domain 3 in Splice network instance 17.

## Verifying port allocation

Run `./scripts/print-config-summary.sh` to print the actual ports used by our main configuration files.

Cluster Deployment
==================

Note that the ports used in our cluster deployments are not identical to the ones used in testing.
For more details on the setup in the cluster, please refer to [the cluster README](../../../../../cluster/README.md).
