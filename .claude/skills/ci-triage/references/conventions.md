# Conventions (these override defaults)

- Refs and runs: record the user's (run, job, ref) tuples verbatim. Never infer refs by elimination.
- Pure ASCII in every file, commit message and PR text. No em dashes, smart quotes, arrows, emoji.
- No code comments in fixes; the reasoning goes in the packet and the commit subject.
- No AI attribution anywhere (no Co-Authored-By, no "generated with"). `Signed-off-by` is the only trailer.
- Commit messages: one subject line plus the DCO sign-off. CI tag mandatory: `[skip ci]` on the triage branch
  (never on a PR branch: it makes the PR unmergeable), `[ci]` on fix branches, `[static]` for lint-only.
- Never commit CLAUDE.md or memory files. The triage branch carries only `ci-triage/`.
- Canton: `canton/` is vendored and stale. The binary is pinned in `nix/canton-sources.json`; runtime log lines
  stand on their own, source citations only against the jar of the version that ran.
- Log-ignore additions are a last resort and must argue why the line can never carry signal. A rejected
  precedent: the IndexerState reconnect WARN (10084) and the P2P auth-token WARN (10010).
- Root cause, not symptom: for a real failure, find what the stalled component was waiting on and why, with a
  timestamped event. Timeouts are never the cause.
- Fix branches: one branch per PR, stacked follow-ups on the same branch, never a branch per fix. Name them
  `<user>/fix-<ref>-<slug>` or `<user>/backport-<ref>-<pr>-<release-line>` so the ref is visible in `git branch` and PR titles. Test-only
  `<user>` is your own short git prefix; the existing branches use `ray`.
  fixes are written; production changes are described and left to the owner unless asked.
- Sandbox limits: do not run sbt compiles or start Canton unless asked; the host does that. The sandbox has
  no read access to DACH-NY/cn-test-failures; the mapping comes from the user.
- Artifacts: `TMPDIR` and `log/<ref>/` on the repo mount (the root overlay is nearly full); keep `.clog.gz`
  compressed and stream with `zcat`.
