SV Governance Voter Prototype
==============================

The governance-voter contract work is a prototype for review under
`Canton Development Fund PR #223 <https://github.com/canton-foundation/canton-dev-fund/pull/223>`_,
especially Milestone 1: Governance-Voting Identity and CIP.

Phase 1 preserves the current one-vote-per-SV model. A governance voter is
intended to be an alternate signer for the represented SV's vote on explicitly
supported non-operational governance actions; it is not a new voting unit and
does not add voting weight.

Vote records carry the represented SV and the party/role that cast the vote.
This attribution is accountability metadata for the authority path; tallying
continues to use the represented SV's vote slot.

The prototype binding is declared by the represented SV and has no contract key.
The intended invariant is one active governance-voter binding per SV. This slice
keeps that invariant outside the template key space so reviewers can decide
whether workflow validation is sufficient or whether a separate registry pattern
is needed before an upstream design is finalized.

The first contract slice uses a hardcoded Daml allowlist for governance-voter
eligible actions. New ``ActionRequiringConfirmation`` constructors are rejected
by default until reviewed and added deliberately. The proposed allowlist is
intended to be concrete enough for maintainer and CIP review, not a final
statement of upstream governance policy. In particular, inclusion of
``SRARC_OffboardSv`` should be validated through that review because it is a
high-impact governance membership action.
