Featured Application Activity Marker
************************************

The *featured application activity marker* is specified in
`CIP 47 <https://github.com/global-synchronizer-foundation/cips/blob/main/cip-0047/cip-0047.md>`__. A summary follows.

Featured application activity markers
(:ref:`FeaturedAppActivityMarker <type-splice-amulet-featuredappactivitymarker-16451>`)
can be created for a transaction that adds value
but does not involve a CC Transfer (e.g., a stable coin transfer or the settlement of a trade).
`CIP 47 <https://github.com/global-synchronizer-foundation/cips/blob/main/cip-0047/cip-0047.md>`__ says:

   Featured application providers are expected to create featured application activity markers only for transactions that
   correspond to a transfer of an asset, or an equivalent transaction, which was enabled by the application provider.
   The detailed fair usage policy and enforcement thereof is left up to the Tokenomics Committee of the Global Synchronizer Foundation (GSF).

Generally the guidance is to create a ``FeaturedAppActivityMarker`` for any economically important event, such as:

- Lock or unlock a Real World Asset (RWA).

- Transfer a RWA.

- Mint or burn tokens.

However, it should not be created for any intermediate steps or a `propose step <https://docs.digitalasset.com/build/3.4/sdlc-howtos/smart-contracts/develop/patterns/propose-accept.html>`__.

A ``FeaturedAppActivityMarker`` is immediately converted into an
:ref:`AppRewardCoupon <type-splice-amulet-apprewardcoupon-57229>` by the automation run by the Super Validators.
The :ref:`AppRewardCoupon <type-splice-amulet-apprewardcoupon-57229>`
is created with the DSO as the ``signatory`` and the ``provider`` field
as an observer. By default, the ``provider`` can mint CC in the minting
step.  The ``featured`` field is set to ``true`` to indicate eligibility to
receive featured application rewards, based on a :ref:`FeaturedAppRight <type-splice-amulet-featuredappright-765>` contract.

There can be several ``FeaturedAppActivityMarkers`` per transaction tree
which increases the total reward. However,  this is only allowed for composed transactions (e.g. a settlement transaction) where trading
venue and all the registries of the transferred assets would get featured app rewards. It is also possible for a single
Canton transaction tree to include
:ref:`ValidatorRewardCoupon <type-splice-amulet-validatorrewardcoupon-76808>`,
an
:ref:`AppRewardCoupon <type-splice-amulet-apprewardcoupon-57229>`
and a
:ref:`FeaturedAppActivityMarker <type-splice-amulet-featuredappactivitymarker-16451>`\ (s)
if there are sub-transcations that create each separately.


A non-featured app cannot accrue a ``FeaturedAppActivityMarker``.

Creating a Featured Application Activity Marker
***********************************************

There are two prerequisites for an application to create a
``FeaturedAppActivityMarker``. The first is to become an approved featured
application which was described in the
:ref:`types_of_activity_records`
section. The second is to update the application code:

   1. Find the fully qualified package-id of the interface definition for the
   :ref:`FeaturedAppRight <type-splice-api-featuredapprightv1-featuredappright-34177>`
   interface which is
   ``7804375fe5e4c6d5afe067bd314c42fe0b7d005a1300019c73154dd939da4dda:Splice.Api.FeaturedAppRightV1:FeaturedAppRight``
   for ``Splice.Api.FeaturedAppRightV1``. The command ``daml damlc
   inspect-dar`` can be used to find this.

   2. Query the ledger using this ID to retrieve contracts from the Daml
   ledger that implement the
   :ref:`FeaturedAppRight <type-splice-api-featuredapprightv1-featuredappright-34177>`
   interface. The ``curl`` example below illustrates this approach.

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl "http://$lapiParticipant/v2/state/active-contracts" \
      "$jwtToken" "application/json" \
         --data-raw '{
         "filter": {
         "filtersByParty": {
               "'$holderPartyId'": {
               "cumulative":
               [
                  {
                     "identifierFilter": {
                     "InterfaceFilter": {
                        "value": {
                           "interfaceId": "'7804375fe5e4c6d5afe067bd314c42fe0b7d005a1300019c73154dd939da4dda:Splice.Api.FeaturedAppRightV1:FeaturedAppRight'",
                           "includeInterfaceView": true,
                           "includeCreatedEventBlob": false
                        }
                     }
                     }
                  }
               ]}
         }
         },
         "verbose": false,
         "activeAtOffset":"'$latestOffset'"
      }'

   3. The application's Daml code will have to depend on the ``splice-api-featured-app-v1.dar`` and take an argument of type ``ContractId FeaturedAppRight`` on the choice
   whose execution should be featured, which allows that choice's body to call the ``FeaturedAppRight_CreateActivityMarker`` in the next step.

   3. In the application's Daml code, using the ``FeaturedAppRight`` interface, exercise
   the ``FeaturedAppRight_CreateActivityMarker`` choice. Set the
   ``templateId`` to the fully qualified interface ID above.

   4. For testing examples, please review the example DamlScript test
   `here <https://github.com/canton-network/splice/blob/a32995a0df2d447b9e76d81b770a06c296295ab5/daml/splice-dso-governance-test/daml/Splice/Scripts/TestFeaturedAppActivityMarkers.daml#L4>`__.

Consider a single, simple transaction of a RWA which creates a single
``FeaturedAppActivityMarker`` activity record for one ``provider`` and
the ``beneficiary`` is the ``provider``:

      1. A :ref:`FeaturedAppActivityMarker <type-splice-amulet-featuredappactivitymarker-16451>` contract is created in the business transaction. The
      ``provider`` is set to the featured application provider's party. The ``beneficiary`` must be set (unlike an
      :ref:`AppRewardCoupon <type-splice-amulet-apprewardcoupon-57229>`) to the party that should be eligible to mint the CC for that activity. The ``provider`` field of the
      FeaturedAppActivityMarker is set by calling the interface choice :ref:`FeaturedAppRight_CreateActivityMarker <type-splice-api-featuredapprightv1-featuredapprightcreateactivitymarker-36646>`.

      2. No ``ValidatorRewardCoupon`` is created.


It is possible to share the attribution of activity for the ``FeaturedAppActivityMarker``. The
``FeaturedAppRight_CreateActivityMarker`` choice accepts a list of
:ref:`AppRewardBeneficiary <type-splice-api-featuredapprightv1-apprewardbeneficiary-32645>`
contracts. Then a ``FeaturedAppActivityMarker`` is created for each
``beneficiary`` with the ``weight`` field set appropriately.
