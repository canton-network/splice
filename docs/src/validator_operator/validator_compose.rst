.. TODO(DACH-NY/canton-network-node#14303): consider reducing duplication. Some requirements & validator onboarding can be moved to a section before we choose the deployment method


.. _compose_validator:

Docker Compose-Based Deployment of a Validator Node
===================================================

This section describes how to deploy a standalone validator node on a VM or a local machine
using `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_. The deployment consists of the validator node along with associated
wallet and CNS UIs, and onboards the validator node to the target network.

This deployment is useful for:

- Application development, where one needs an ephemeral validator that is easy to deploy.

- Production validators, with the following caveats:

  - The default deployment is highly insecure. Authentication should be enabled as described in :ref:`the authentication section <compose_validator_auth>`.

  - There is no support for ingress from outside your machine, nor is there support for TLS.
    The deployment should be kept local to your machine only and not exposed externally.

  - Reliability & scalability: docker-compose will restart containers that crash, and the deployment supports backup&restore as detailed below, but a
    docker-compose deployment is inherently more limited than a cloud-based Kubernetes one.

  - Monitoring: The deployment, as opposed to a Kubernetes-based one, does not include monitoring.

  - For production settings, you should aim to keep your validator up and running constantly,
    in order to avoid losing out on rewards, and avoid issues with catching up on ledger state
    after significant downtime.

.. _validator_compose_prerequisites:

Requirements
++++++++++++

1) A linux/MacOS machine with the following:

   a. `docker compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__ - at least version 2.26.0 or newer
   b. `curl <https://curl.se/>`__
   c. `jq <https://jqlang.org/>`__

   Note that both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures are supported.

To validate that the dependencies are set up correctly, run the
following commands. All commands should succeed and print out the
version. Note that the exact versions you see may be different from
the example here. As long as you have docker-compose 2.26.0 or newer you should be fine.

.. code-block:: bash

   > docker compose version
   Docker Compose version 2.32.1
   > curl --version
   curl 8.11.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.11.0 OpenSSL/3.3.2 zlib/1.3.1 brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.6 libidn2/2.3.7 libpsl/0.21.5 libssh2/1.11.1 nghttp2/1.64.0

   Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ipfs ipns mqtt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp
   Features: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli GSS-API HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IDN IPv6 Kerberos Largefile libz NTLM PSL SPNEGO SSL threadsafe TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd
   > jq --version
   jq-1.7.1

2) Your machine should either be connected to a VPN that is whitelisted on the network
   (contact your sponsor SV to obtain access), or have a static egress IP address.
   In the latter case, please provide that IP address to your sponsor SV to
   add it to the firewall rules.

3) Please download the release artifacts containing the docker-compose files, from here: |bundle_download_link|, and extract the bundle:

.. parsed-literal::

  tar xzvf |version|\_splice-node.tar.gz

.. include:: ../common/backup_suggestion.rst

.. include:: required_network_parameters.rst

Additional parameters describing your own setup as opposed to the connection to the network are described below.

.. _validator-http-proxy-compose:

HTTP Proxy configuration
------------------------

If you need to use an HTTP forward proxy for egress in your environment, you need to set ``https.proxyHost`` and ``https.proxyPort``
in `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` in ``splice-node/docker-compose/validator/compose.yaml`` to use the HTTP proxy for outgoing connections.
You need to do this for both the validator and the participant services:

.. code-block:: yaml

  services:
    validator:
      environment:
        JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: >-
          -Dhttps.proxyHost=your.proxy.host
          -Dhttps.proxyPort=your_proxy_port

.. code-block:: yaml

  services:
    participant:
      environment:
        JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: >-
          -Dhttps.proxyHost=your.proxy.host
          -Dhttps.proxyPort=your_proxy_port

Replace ``your.proxy.host`` and ``your_proxy_port`` with the actual host and port of your HTTP proxy.
Proxy authentication is currently not supported.

Bypassing the proxy for specific hosts
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

   Setting ``http.nonProxyHosts`` affects:

   - The HTTP client used by the CN apps (Validator, Scan, SV, Wallet).
   - JDK-level HTTP clients in the same JVM (via the default ``ProxySelector``).
     This includes the Auth0 JWK library used by the CN apps **and** by the
     Canton participant for JWKS / OIDC discovery, as well as file downloads
     that use ``java.net.HttpURLConnection``.
   - gRPC egress from other components, because gRPC's Netty transport delegates proxy
     decisions to the default JDK ``ProxySelector``.

You can set ``http.nonProxyHosts`` to bypass the proxy for specific target
hosts. Matching hosts will be contacted directly rather than through the
configured proxy. This is useful for services that are reachable on the local
network, such as an in-cluster Scan instance or internal monitoring endpoints.

The value is a ``|``-separated list of patterns that follows the standard Java ``nonProxyHosts``
grammar:

- Patterns match the request host name case-insensitively.
- ``*`` is a wildcard. Conventionally it is used at the start (``*.internal``) or end (``10.*``)
  of a pattern.
- Matching is performed on the raw host string from the request URI. No DNS resolution is performed,
  so ``localhost`` and ``127.0.0.1`` are treated as different names unless you list both.
- An empty value (e.g. ``-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=``) means "no bypass patterns".


Example that proxies external traffic from the ``validator`` service but bypasses the proxy for
``localhost`` / ``127.0.0.1``, any host in the ``.internal`` domain, and any IPv4 address whose
literal string representation starts with ``10.``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  services:
    validator:
      environment:
        JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: >-
          -Dhttps.proxyHost=your.proxy.host
          -Dhttps.proxyPort=your_proxy_port
          -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=localhost|127.0.0.1|*.internal|10.*

Deployment
++++++++++

1) Change to the `docker-compose` directory inside the extracted bundle:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd splice-node/docker-compose/validator

2) Export the current version to an environment variable: |image_tag_set|

3) Run the following command to start the validator node, and wait for it to become ready (could take a few minutes):

  .. code-block:: bash

    ./start.sh -s "<SPONSOR_SV_URL>" -o "<ONBOARDING_SECRET>" -p "<party_hint>" -m "<MIGRATION_ID>" -w

  Where:

  ``<party_hint>`` will be used as the prefix of the Party ID of your validator's administrator.
     This must be of format `<organization>-<function>-<enumerator>`, e.g. `myCompany-myWallet-1`.
     It cannot be changed over time as it is part of the validator operator party ID.

Note that the validator may be stopped with the command ``./stop.sh`` and restarted again with the same ``start.sh``
command as above. Its data will be retained between invocations. In subseqent invocations, the secret itself may be
left empty, but the ``-o`` is still mandatory, so a ``-o ""`` argument should be provided.

Logging into the wallet UI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

   Docker Compose-based validator deployments use ``.localhost`` subdomains for addressing, such as ``wallet.localhost``.
   ``.localhost`` URLs reportedly do not work on some browsers.
   If you encounter issues please try using a different browser such as Firefox or Chrome.
   If you're encountering issues with reaching APIs from a custom program or script,
   you may need to set the ``HOST`` header on HTTP requests explicitly to the target ``.localhost`` address.

The wallet UI is accessible at http://wallet.localhost in your browser. The validator administrator's
username is `administrator`. Insert that name into the username field and click `Log in`, and
you should see the wallet of the administrator of your wallet.

You can also logout of the administrator account and login as any other username. The first time a
user logs in, they will be prompted with a message asking them to confirm whether they wish to be
onboarded to the validator node.

.. todo:: link to section that explains what this onbarding means


Logging into the CNS UI
+++++++++++++++++++++++

You can open your browser at http://ans.localhost (note that this is currently by default
`ans` and not `cns`), and login using the same administrator user, or any other user that has been onboarded
via the wallet, in order to purchase a CNS entry for that user.

.. _compose_canton_apis:

Accessing the Canton Participant APIs
-------------------------------------

The `JSON Ledger API <https://docs.digitalasset.com/build/3.4/tutorials/json-api/canton_and_the_json_ledger_api.html>`_
is exposed under ``json-ledger-api.localhost:80``. Note that for some
clients you may explicitly need to set the ``Host:
json-ledger-api.localhost`` header for this to get resolved correctly.

The `gRPC Ledger API
<https://docs.digitalasset.com/build/3.4/explanations/ledger-api-services.html>`_
is exposed under ``grpc-ledger-api.localhost:80``. Note that for some
clients you may explicitly need to set the ``:authority:
json-ledger-api.localhost`` pseudo-header for this to get resolved correctly.

The Canton Admin API is not exposed by default as it does not yet
support auth.  There is a commented out section in ``nginx.conf`` that
you can enable to expose it if you ensure that it is not exposed
publicly, e.g., through network restrictions.


.. _compose_validator_auth:

Configuring Authentication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning::

  The default deployment uses highly insecure self-signed tokens. Anyone with access to the wallet UI
  (or the machine and/or its network interface) may log in to your wallet as a user of their choice.
  For any production use, you should configure proper authentication as described in this section.

Please refer to the :ref:`authentication section <helm-validator-auth-requirements>` for instructions on how
to set up an OAuth provider for your validator. The URLs to configure for callbacks are
``http://wallet.localhost`` and ``http://ans.localhost``.

Once you have set up your OAuth provider,
you need to configure it by setting the following environment variables in the ``.env`` file:

============================= ===========================================================================
Name                          Value
----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTH_URL                      The URL of your OIDC provider for obtaining the ``openid-configuration`` and ``jwks.json``.
AUTH_JWKS_URL                 The URL of your OIDC provider for obtaining the ``jwks.json``, will typically be ``${AUTH_URL}/.well-known/jwks.json``.
AUTH_WELLKNOWN_URL            The URL of your OIDC provider for obtaining the ``openid-configuration``, will typically be ``${AUTH_URL}/.well-known/openid-configuration``.
LEDGER_API_AUTH_AUDIENCE      The audience for the participant ledger API. e.g. ``https://ledger_api.example.com``.
                              This will set the ``ledger-api.auth-services.target-audience`` configuration for the participant.
LEDGER_API_AUTH_SCOPE         The scope for the participant ledger API.
                              This will set the participant's ``ledger-api.auth-services.target-scope`` configuration. Optional
VALIDATOR_AUTH_AUDIENCE       The audience for the validator backend API. e.g. ``https://validator.example.com``.
VALIDATOR_AUTH_CLIENT_ID      The client id of the OAuth app for the validator app backend.
VALIDATOR_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET  The client secret of the OAuth app for the validator app backend.
LEDGER_API_ADMIN_USER         Should match the `sub` field of JWTs issued for the validator app. For some auth providers, this would be formed as ``CLIENT_ID@clients``.
WALLET_ADMIN_USER             The user ID of the user which should login as the wallet administrator. Note that this should be the full user id, e.g., ``auth0|43b68e1e4978b000cefba352``, *not* only the suffix ``43b68e1e4978b000cefba352``.
WALLET_UI_CLIENT_ID           The client id of the OAuth app for the wallet UI.
ANS_UI_CLIENT_ID              The client id of the OAuth app for the CNS UI.
CONTACT_POINT                 The contact point for your validator node that can be used by other node operators to reach out to you if needed (slack username or an email address). Optional
============================= ===========================================================================

In order to enable auth in the deployment, add the `-a` flag to the `start.sh`
command, as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./start.sh -s "<SPONSOR_SV_URL>" -o "<ONBOARDING_SECRET>" -p "<party_hint>" -m "<MIGRATION_ID>" -w -a

If you have already deployed a non-authenticated validator on your machine, you can migrate it to an
authenticated one by stopping the validator with `./stop.sh` and restarting it with the `-a` flag
as above. The validator operator user will be automatically migrated, and the user indicated by the
`WALLET_ADMIN_USER` variable will be associated with the validator operator party. If you have also
onboarded other users onto your validator, those will not be automatically migrated, and you need
to manually associate the OAuth users with their corresponding parties. In order to do that,
first take note of the party IDs of all relevant users (do this before stopping the unauthenticated
validator), e.g. by copying them from the top-right corner of their wallet UIs. Now for every user that
you wish to migrate, follow the instructions for associating a user with a party in the
:ref:`Users, Parties and Wallets in the Splice Wallet section <validator-users>`, but replace
the admin party ID with the party ID which you wish to associate with each user.

.. _compose_validator_topup:

Configuring Automatic Traffic Purchases
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Your node is configured to automatically purchase :ref:`traffic <traffic>` on a pay-as-you-go basis
(see :ref:`automatically purchase traffic <traffic_topup>`).
To tune to your needs, you can set environment variables, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export TARGET_TRAFFIC_THROUGHPUT=20000 # target throughput in bytes/second
   export MIN_TRAFFIC_TOPUP_INTERVAL="1m" # minimum interval between top-ups

.. include:: ../common/traffic_topups.rst

.. _compose_auto_sweeps:

Configuring sweeps and auto-accepts of transfer offers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: ../common/wallet_sweeps.rst

To do so, fill the following section and add the following additional config to your validator environment:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # sweep by transferring directly through the transfer preapproval of the receiver,
   # if set to false sweeping creates transfer offers that need to be accepted on the receiver side.
   # Note that this refers to the preapprovals described in https://docs.dev.sync.global/background/preapprovals.html
   # and not to auto accepting transfers. Auto accept transfers does not setup preapproval contracts that allow
   # for a direct transfer but just automates the acceptance of the transfer offer so in that case
   # useTransferPreapproval should be set to false.
   services:
     validator:
       environment:
          - |
             ADDITIONAL_CONFIG_WALLET_SWEEP=
               canton.validator-apps.validator_backend.wallet-sweep {
                 "<senderPartyId1>" {
                   max-balance-usd = 1000
                   min-balance-usd = 100
                   receiver = "<receiverPartyId>"
                   use-transfer-preapproval = false
                 }
               }

Similarly, you can configure the validator to automatically accept transfer offers
from certain parties on the network. To do so, add the following additional config:

.. code-block:: yaml

   services:
     validator:
       environment:
          - |
             ADDITIONAL_CONFIG_AUTO_ACCEPT_TRANSFERS=
               canton.validator-apps.validator_backend.auto-accept-transfers {
                 "<receiverPartyId>" {
                   from-parties = ["<senderPartyId1>", "<senderPartyId2>"]
                 }
               }

Integration with systemd and other init systems
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to manage the validator through systemd or a similar init
system, create a service that calls the ``start.sh`` script with the
right arguments. However, note that ``start.sh`` invokes ``docker
compose up`` with the ``-d/--detach`` option so the script exits after
the containers are up instead of continuing running.

You need to make sure that your service does not stop docker compose
at that point. To accomplish this with systemd set
``RemainAfterExit=true``. Refer to the
`systemd documentation <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html>`_
for more details. If you are using another init system, look for similar options to ensure that docker compose continues running after the script exits.

Alternatively, you can edit the script to remove the ``-d`` option so the script continues running.
